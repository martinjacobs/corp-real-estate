**_Are corporate real estate assets a cost, or a competitive differentiator?_**

This question offers a window into a company’s culture. It is typically the third highest cost (after
salaries and benefits), so a value engineering mindset is certainly important. However, If an organization
only applies a financial lens to decision-making, short-term cost-cutting deliverables will be met at the
expense of long-term value creation. Companies with the wisdom to see value not evident in direct
financial tiebacks stand to realize big gains over those that don’t. The right real estate strategy can boost
employee retention, foster productivity, showcase innovation, and strengthen a company’s brand. It
makes sure that capital gets spent in the right place, at the right time, with solutions that not only meet
today’s needs, but future proof the needs of tomorrow. We are in a period of disruption. Old metrics,
assumptions, and operational models don’t work anymore and the fallout across the industry is ongoing.
This makes it an exceptionally bad time to set it and forget it. Companies that cling to old ways of
working risk being stuck with an outdated employee value proposition and sky-high costs to dig
themselves out of it. With proper oversight, smart, targeted investments tied to portfolio optimization
can transform a company’s workplace in a positive way as it right sizes itself.

It&#39;s critical to have Corporate Real Estate strategists on staff to connect the dots. We carefully monitor
economic conditions, worker trends, evolving technologies, peer work environments, and strategic
partnerships across multiple markets. We also offer the governance to ensure executive alignment on
the workplace, which is deeply personal to employees. The pace of economic changes and societal
shifts has elevated the need for Corporate Real Estate Professionals who can translate the convergence
of these factors into a purposeful strategy that aligns with corporate business drivers. We help
executives contain costs while still uplevelling the employee experience. All this takes time and
expertise, which is why having us on your team brings back dividends that far outweigh our salaries.

In this period of economic uncertainty, it’s tempting to save some headcount by reducing CRE
management to basic procurement and operational functions. Do so at your own risk, because the cost
in lost value creation opportunities, bad investments, and negative employee perceptions will haunt you
for years to come.
