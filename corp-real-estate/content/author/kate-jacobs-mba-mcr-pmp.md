With over 25 years working in IT, Project Management, and Corporate Real Estate roles within the High Tech sector, I am excited to start my blog to write about my experiences.  I have had the amazing opportunity to manage the full life cycle of properties from site selection, lease negotiation, capital build outs, operations, and surrender. I am passionate about linking opportunities and sharing lessons learned how gotcha's can be corrected across the different phases of lease management, and about international/cultural understanding.
