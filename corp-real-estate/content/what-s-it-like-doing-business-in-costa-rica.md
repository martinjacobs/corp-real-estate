**_This blog covers my experiences setting up business operations in Costa Rica and things I learned along the way_**

Time was tight. Our business had a firm commitment to start hiring within 6 months to support their growth plans, but we were starting at zero. We had no presence, no experience, no in country connections. How did we get it done?

I am taking stock of the things I wish I had known at the beginning, and looking ahead to the next year of maturing our operations and preparing for our first audit.

**Dependencies everywhere**

Entities must be set up before bank accounts can be created. Leases can’t be signed without the entity. Security deposits can’t be paid without the bank account. Someone local needs to be identified to be an officer of the new entity, but you can’t hire until your entity is set up.

When you are starting the process to establish a corporate presence in a new country, every step is dependent on something else. All these dependencies can make it hard to gain traction and meet internal delivery commitments.

**Different cost structures**

Labor might be cheaper, but other things are more expensive: Very few goods are manufactured in Costa Rica, so just about everything is imported. Expect higher costs and long lead times for construction and to procure items. Operating costs and rental rates are also higher than in the US, and the country’s economic boon has created a prolonged environment favorable to land lords.

**Free Trade Regime compliance**

Getting through all the bureaucratic steps to achieve your Free Trade “Zona Franca” status might feel like the end of a long process. You will by this time have survived completing your application submission, made several revisions prior to PROCOMER approval, waited through COMEX review and approval, and finally achieved signature by the president of Costa Rica. Only then to realize you must then apply for and receive your Customs Declaration “H” number (Customs needs this number before you can import anything tax free) and then getting your sanitation and operations permits so that you can officially start operations in the country. By this time you might think your interactions with the Costa Rican government is winding down. But, no. You will have an ongoing relationship with PROCOMER, who will stop by to conduct a training (in Spanish only, see “Tico time” below) to educate you about how to stay compliant within the regime through annual audits, and how to communicate with them should you need to “export” any good out of the FTZ area, which is essentially treated like its own mini country within a country for even minor routine activities like computer and copier repairs, and how you will be required to account for every asset each year during the audit. Look forward to developing special processes for how to asset tag every good in your office, and account for all the money you spend with the free trade regime.

**Customs Brokerage** 

There’s no way around it, this is just a cost of doing business if you are in a free trade regime. You will need one to represent you, to help you prepare the complex paperwork and to pull your shipments out of Customs and deliver it to your premises. The earlier you engage one the better because they are a wealth of knowledge about how to navigate the import process. They become consultants in how to successfully navigate the system in addition to a transactional partner. You should absolutely interview several and terms are completely negotiable, although they won’t tell you this up front.

**BOMA does not apply**

Land lords include vertical penetrations, stairwells, elevators, and building mechanical/common areas in their square footage calculations. This means they are charging rent for this (on top of variable charges).  You need to factor this into your useable space assessments to make sure you are targeting the right size floorplate in your site selections, and build the hidden costs for this square footage you can't use into your financial models.  It can also be hard to add these floor plans into iWMS systems that automatically apply the standards.

**Corruption was not an issue**

North Americans fret about Central America’s reputation for quid pro quo kickbacks, but all my interactions were straightforward and above the board. In conversations with locals, they attribute the high level of government oversight on free trade regime affiliated company finances as having eliminated these practices from Costa Rica’s business environment

**Social protocols are different**

North Americans have a straightforward communication style that favors direct feedback and frank discourse promoting a specific outcome or point of view.  Communication in Costa Rica favors maintaining a positive relationship and respectful interactions, which creates a very genteel environment that can lead to conflict avoidance.  This can lead to misunderstandings, because people may appear to commit to things, and then not follow through because they don't want to contradict you in face to face conversation, or have to "tell you no".  In order to mitigate this pitfall, follow up every conversation with a written summary of what you believe was agreed.  Do not assume you have agreement without getting a response from them in writing affirming that understanding, no matter what was said verbally in face to face meetings.

**Tico Time**

Costa Ricans call themselves “Tico’s” and their own expression “Tico time” reflects their cultural penchant to be lax with schedules. It can be difficult to manage a business when vendors come and go with casual evasiveness to fixed appointments. It’s always an issue, but can be mitigated by having hard and fast rules about what your business is willing to do when. If they realize they will be turned away, they will pay much closer attention to their commitments. On business trips, plan some extra time for no shows.

**Postal Addresses**

Street addresses are descriptive and lack numbering conventions. An attempt was made to create ZIP codes, but when you ask any local they will swear that they aren’t used and not to trust them. Look forward to finding places with directions like “it’s 600 meters north of the Walmart”. Not only does this make travelling there an adventure, but getting things set up in big name systems like SAP and Ariba can be tricky, with their required fields.

**Vendors**

More often than not, large companies we are used to doing business with do not have established operations in Costa Rica, and we were forced to establish new partnerships rather than extend existing ones. Many enterprises are family run affairs, which definitely has its positive side as you are cultivating meaningful relationships with a small network of people, rather than the bureaucracy of a large enterprise. However, it has its downsides too, as they don’t carry property and general liability insurances to US norms. It’s not realistic to expect them to meet US standards in this area so some education with back at HQ with procurement, risk, and other departments early in the project is recommended to decide up front how your company will adjust its policies to meet local norms.

**Local Accountants** 

In addition to payroll and making local payments for goods and services rendered in country, they are experts in how to keep the paperwork that is required for the annual PROCOMER audit. It’s best to hire locally to a group that is experienced in how to keep the documentation and multiple years of physical receipts on your behalf.

**Hiring 3rd party contractors**

Although it is common business practice in the US to hire contractors to fill in spikes in workload as an alterative to permanent hires, employment laws in Costa Rica create more employer obligations towards contractors which negate the value proposition of hiring contingent labor at a higher hourly cost in exchange for flexibility.  Make sure you understand the local laws and the obligations they place on your company before hiring contractors.

**Takeaways**

Starting business in a new country is a learning curve that requires quick adoption to local culture, laws, and business practices.  Enter the process with a growth mindset and ability to adapt.  Finding local partners to help you through it is the key to success.
