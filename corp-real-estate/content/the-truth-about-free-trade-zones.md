**_This blog covers my experiences setting up business operations in Costa Rica and things I learned along the way_** 

Time was tight. Our business had a firm commitment to start hiring within 6 months to support their

growth plans, but we were starting at zero. We had no presence, no experience, no in country

connections. How did we get it done?

Dependencies everywhere: Entities must be set up before bank accounts can be created. Leases can’t

be signed without the entity. Security deposits can’t be paid without the bank account. Someone local

needs to be identified to be an officer of the new entity, but you can’t hire until your entity is set up.

When you are starting the process to establish a corporate presence in a new country, every step is

dependent on something else. All these dependencies can make it hard to gain traction and meet

internal delivery commitments.

Labor might be cheaper, but other things are more expensive: Very few goods are manufactured in

Costa Rica, so just about everything is imported. Expect higher costs and long lead times for

construction and to procure items. Operating costs and rental rates are also higher than in the US, and

the country’s economic boon has created a prolonged environment favorable to land lords.

BOMA need not apply: Land lords include vertical penetrations, stairwells, elevators, and building

mechanical/common areas in their square footage calculations. This means they are charging rent for

this (on top of variable charges), and also that you need to factor this into your useable space

assessments to make sure you are targeting the right size floorplate in your site selections.

Corruption was not an issue: North Americans fret about Central America’s reputation for quid pro quo

kickbacks, but all my interactions were straightforward and above the board. In conversations with

locals, they attribute the high level of government oversight on free trade regime affiliated company

finances as having eliminated these practices from Costa Rica’s corporate culture.

Social protocols are different: I asked advice of Latin American friends about cultural differences. Their

biggest piece of advice was to get it in writing.

Tico Time: Costa Ricans call themselves “Tico’s” and their own expression “Tico time” reflects their

cultural penchant to be lax with schedules. It can be difficult to manage a business when vendors come

and go with casual evasiveness to fixed appointments. It’s always an issue, but can be mitigated by

having hard and fast rules about what your business is willing to do when. If they realize they will be

turned away, they will pay much closer attention to their commitments.

Hiring 3 rd party contractors: Although it is common business practice in the US to hire contractors to fill

in spikes in workload,

Be ready to offer a wider variety of services:
