**_This blog covers my experiences setting up business operations in Costa Rica and things I learned along the way_**

Time was tight. Our business had a firm commitment to start hiring within 6 months to support their growth plans, but we were starting at zero. We had no presence, no experience, no in country connections. How did we get it done?

**Dependencies everywhere**

Entities must be set up before bank accounts can be created. Leases can’t be signed without the entity. Security deposits can’t be paid without the bank account. Someone local needs to be identified to be an officer of the new entity, but you can’t hire until your entity is set up.

When you are starting the process to establish a corporate presence in a new country, every step is dependent on something else. All these dependencies can make it hard to gain traction and meet internal delivery commitments.

**Different cost structures**

Labor might be cheaper, but other things are more expensive: Very few goods are manufactured in Costa Rica, so just about everything is imported. Expect higher costs and long lead times for construction and to procure items. Operating costs and rental rates are also higher than in the US, and the country’s economic boon has created a prolonged environment favorable to land lords.

**BOMA does not apply**

Land lords include vertical penetrations, stairwells, elevators, and building mechanical/common areas in their square footage calculations. This means they are charging rent for this (on top of variable charges).  You need to factor this into your useable space assessments to make sure you are targeting the right size floorplate in your site selections, and build the hidden costs for this square footage you can't use into your financial models.

**Corruption was not an issue**

North Americans fret about Central America’s reputation for quid pro quo kickbacks, but all my interactions were straightforward and above the board. In conversations with locals, they attribute the high level of government oversight on free trade regime affiliated company finances as having eliminated these practices from Costa Rica’s business environment

**Social protocols are different**

North Americans have a straightforward communication style that favors direct feedback and frank discourse promoting a specific outcome or point of view.  Communication in Costa Rica favors maintaining a positive relationship and respectful interactions, which creates a very genteel environment that can lead to conflict avoidance.  This can lead to misunderstandings, because people may appear to commit to things, and then not follow through because they don't want to contradict you in face to face conversation, or have to "tell you no".  In order to mitigate this pitfall, follow up every conversation with a written summary of what you believe was agreed.  Do not assume you have agreement without getting a response from them in writing affirming that understanding, no matter what was said verbally in face to face meetings.

**Tico Time**

Costa Ricans call themselves “Tico’s” and their own expression “Tico time” reflects their cultural penchant to be lax with schedules. It can be difficult to manage a business when vendors come and go with casual evasiveness to fixed appointments. It’s always an issue, but can be mitigated by having hard and fast rules about what your business is willing to do when. If they realize they will be turned away, they will pay much closer attention to their commitments.

**Hiring 3rd party contractors**

Although it is common business practice in the US to hire contractors to fill in spikes in workload as an alterative to permanent hires, employment laws in Costa Rica create more employer obligations towards contractors which negate the value proposition of hiring contingent labor at a higher hourly cost in exchange for flexibility.  Make sure you understand the local laws and the obligations they place on your company before hiring contractors.

**Takeaways**

Starting business in a new country is a learning curve that requires quick adoption to local culture, laws, and business practices.  Enter the process with a growth mindset and willingness to adapt.  Finding local partners to help you through it is the key to success.
