**_In 2017 I negotiated a lease in a prime building in S_**_Ã£**o Paulo.  At the three year anniversary of the lease execution, the landlord initiated a rent review, requesting to renegotiate rental rates.**_

**What is this, you may ask? This is a 5 year lease! What is going on?**

Experienced Corporate Real Estate professionals know that whatever terms may be included in a lease, local laws may still supersede that language.  Although this can be true anywhere, it is especially noteworthy in Brazil.  Whereas US lease negotiations focus on locking in fixed terms and durations, real estate law in Brazil is more fluid.

In my example above, formalized base rental rates had been negotiated in 2017, through 2022.  My landlord knew that Real Estate Lease Law in Brazil entitled them to renegotiate at the three year mark, and had paid attention to vacancy rates and inventory in our micro market. They knew their rights, and that they stood to gain from exercising it.  It is important to note that this law cuts both ways - tenants also can request to renegotiate if they are paying over market. Not knowing your tenancy rights under the law could lead to a missed opportunity to readjust rates in your favor.  

The lease term can also be fluid, with tenants having rights to terminate before the formal end date of the contract.  In the negotiation I was involved with, the lessors were highly motivated to build in early term penalties into the contract, even though there was no formal early term right listed. 

**Broker Fees**

Lessee's may also be surprised that they are expected to pay their own broker fees.  Unlike in the US, where the landlord bears the burden of paying all brokers, in Brazil it is custom for each side of the table to pay for their own representation directly.  

**Surrender Clauses**

Also make sure you understand up front what will be expected of you at lease end.  Unlike the standard "removal of Furniture, Fixtures, & Equipment and leave broom clean" surrender clause of North American leases, the default norm in Brazil is that you will be expected to bring your leased space back to shell condition. Budget for this cost up front so finance isn't surprised, and make sure to plan sufficient time to complete the work before lease end.  There's always the chance you might be able to negotiate with the landlord at lease end to leave some things in place, but don't expect it.  Under Brazilian customs, tenant is on the hook for the dilapidations.

**Condominium style office buildings**

Making informed decisions in site selection and being an effective negotiator requires a basic understanding of other differences in common practices for building ownership and landlord structures.

Unlike in the US where most corporate office buildings are governed by one landlord/REIT, it is common in Brazil for there to be multiple owners within the same building. Costs for common area maintenance are covered through a condominium agreement which is operated by a building management company.    Tenants pay the rent in one invoice, and a second "condominium fee" invoice is paid to the management company.  In good times this works well.  It can also create challenges, however, as no one owner has a full stake or vision in the holistic state of the building.  In challenging economic times, landlords who have a smaller stake may wish to defer funding for the association, creating challenges for  tenants who expect consistency in building operations.  Smaller landlords may be less motivated or lack the staff to respond to tenant issues as the property you have leased may not be their core business. This is why, when doing site selection, it is critical to include the landlord's reputation, size and scale in to your site selection criteria. You also want to fully vet the building's shared amenities to make sure they are properly maintained.

From an operational perspective, the scope of condominium fees is very limited compared to the typical landlord operating budget in the US. It excludes your leased space, so each tenant has to arrange their own vendors for cleaning and maintenance, and if something breaks, call your own vendors to make repairs.  This is a notable difference from North American norms where services like cleaning your leased space are managed by the landlord and billed back.  Expect to have to source and maintain multiple vendor contracts outside the formal lease in order to achieve full operations and maintenance of your space.  

**Bottom Line:  Working internationally is a lot of fun and can turbo charge professional and personal growth by exposing you to different ways of doing things. Be humble, and don't expect US norms to apply in Brazil.  When doing site selection and negotiating a lease, make sure to align with strong local legal and brokerage representation to guide you through the process. Ask questions, lots of questions.  You need to take the time to know the basic lay of the land before jumping into a lease contract in Brazil.  Don't miss out on your rights by bypassing the opportunity to learn about them.**
